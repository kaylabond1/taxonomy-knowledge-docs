Terrifier 3 is a 2024 American Christmas supernatural slasher film written, edited, and directed by Damien Leone. It is the sequel to Terrifier 2 (2022) and the third installment in the Terrifier film series. The film stars David Howard Thornton, Lauren LaVera, Elliott Fullam, and Samantha Scaffidi. On the days leading up to Christmas, the story follows Sienna Shaw as she attempts to rebuild her life. At the same time, Art the Clown is pursuing her alongside his new accomplice, a possessed Victoria Heyes.

Following the critical and commercial success of Terrifier 2, Leone began writing for the third film with plans for an overarching narrative. Leone wanted to feature Victoria more prominently, as he regretted leaving the character underdeveloped in the first film. Principal photography began in February 2024 on a $2 million budget, and wrapped that April.

The film received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $68 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing unrated film of all timeAfter being beheaded by Sienna Shaw,[a] Art the Clown's headless body decapitates a cop responding to the incident, and make its way to the asylum where survivor Victoria Heyes, now possessed by the Little Pale Girl, has just given birth to Art's own head. After reattaching his head to his body, Art and Victoria kill a nurse and a guard before entering an abandoned house and going into hibernation.

Five years later, Sienna is released from a mental health center to stay with her aunt Jess, her husband Greg and their daughter Gabbie, who idolizes Sienna but has no knowledge of the events she endured. Sienna is suffering from survivor guilt and frequently has hallucinations of her deceased best friend Brooke, whose death[a] she feels responsible for. She struggles to reconnect with her younger brother Jonathan, who is now in college trying to move on with his life. Art and Victoria are woken from their slumber when two demolition workers stumble upon them in the house. The duo kills the workers, and Victoria begins working on a costume, while Art ventures off on another killing spree. Art meets a Santa Claus impersonator at a bar, where Art kills him and takes his Santa costume. Art then poses as a mall Santa and uses explosives disguised as presents to kill several people at the mall, many of them children. Sienna thinks she sees Art at the mall in disguise before the explosion, but does not tell her family since she thinks they would not believe her and is unsure herself if it was simply a hallucination or not.

Sienna visits Jonathan at his university. There she meets Jonathan's roommate Cole and his girlfriend Mia, who hosts a true crime podcast. Mia pressures Sienna and Jonathan to participate in an interview about the Miles County Massacre, but Sienna lashes out. Sienna confesses to Jonathan that she thinks Art is still alive, and shows Jonathan the letters he wrote to her while she was in the psychiatric hospital, which state that demons can be reborn and possess hosts like Victoria. She also tells Jonathan she plans to return to the Terrifier haunted attraction to retrieve her father's sword. Art arrives at the university and kills Mia and Cole with a chainsaw. Sienna learns about the mall killings on the news and panics, demanding Jonathan return home from college and warning the family they are not safe. Greg leaves to collect Jonathan while Sienna falls asleep; she dreams about angels crafting the armor from her warrior costume that her father drew for her. Sienna wakes to hear Jess and her husband downstairs discussing what they should do about her worsening condition. When she walks into the dining room, Sienna instead finds Art and Victoria decorating Greg's decapitated and eviscerated body pinned to the wall. Sienna runs but is then incapacitated by Art with a mallet.

As Sienna regains consciousness, she sees Jess tied up across from her, and Greg's severed head used as the star on their Christmas tree. Victoria shows them a skinless head being consumed by rats, telling her it is Gabbie's. Art kills Jess by hammering a tube into her throat and forcing rats down it. Art suddenly enters with Gabbie as a hostage, and Victoria claims to Sienna that the head is Jonathan's. Vicky places a crown of thorns on Sienna's head and tries to possess her, but she resists because her will is not yet broken. Victoria tells Sienna to open her Christmas gift from Gabbie. Sienna however, breaks free and decapitates Victoria with her father's sword which she hid in the present. Victoria's pool of blood burns through the floor and creates a portal to Hell. As Sienna and Art fight, Gabbie falls in and holds onto the edge. Sienna finally gains an advantage by impaling Art to a wall, but leaves him in order to save Gabbie, who eventually falls into the abyss with the sword. Art flees through a window, while Sienna vows to find and rescue Gabbie. As Sienna looks at her wounded hands, the hand heals immediately implying she got her angelic powers.

In the final scene, Art is seen boarding a bus with a passenger and driver, who are disturbed by his appearance.
